## **Refined Problem Statement**

**How can we identify, analyze, and mitigate the impact of "ghost reviews" (reviews tied to inactive businesses) on customer decision-making and competitor revenue, while advocating for platform-level reforms to improve review ecosystem integrity?**

---

## **Key Questions to Ask**

### **For Consumers**
1. How do ghost reviews influence consumer trust and decision-making?
2. Are consumers aware that some reviews may be tied to inactive businesses?
3. What tools or indicators would help consumers identify and disregard ghost reviews?

### **For Businesses**
1. How do ghost reviews impact competitors in the same industry or location?
2. What is the economic cost of ghost reviews in terms of redirected footfall or revenue leakage?
3. How can businesses protect themselves from the negative effects of ghost reviews?

### **For Review Platforms**
1. Why do ghost reviews persist, and what challenges do platforms face in addressing them?
2. What reforms (e.g., inactivity tagging, automated review archiving) could improve the integrity of review systems?
3. How can platforms balance the need for accurate reviews with the volume of user-generated content?

## **Expanded Solutioning**

### **1. Data Identification**
   - **Objective**: Identify and collect reviews tied to inactive businesses.
   - **Approach**:
     - Use web scraping tools (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Selenium) to extract reviews from platforms like Google Reviews, Yelp, and TripAdvisor.
     - Cross-reference business listings with public databases (e.g., business registries, Google Maps) to identify inactive businesses.
     - Develop a classifier to flag potentially inactive businesses based on indicators like:
       - Lack of recent activity (e.g., no new reviews, no updates to business profile).
       - Closure announcements or marked-as-permanently-closed tags.
   - **Output**: A dataset of ghost reviews tied to inactive businesses.

---

### **2. Sentiment Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Determine whether ghost reviews are misleading, outdated, or still relevant.
   - **Approach**:
     - Use sentiment analysis models (e.g., VADER, BERT) to analyze the tone and content of ghost reviews.
     - Categorize reviews into:
       - **Misleading**: Positive reviews for a business that no longer exists, potentially diverting customers to competitors.
       - **Outdated**: Negative reviews for a business that has since closed, unfairly impacting competitors.
       - **Neutral/Irrelevant**: Reviews that have no significant impact on decision-making.
     - Quantify the proportion of misleading and outdated reviews.
   - **Output**: Sentiment classification and impact assessment of ghost reviews.

---

### **3. Economic Impact Study**
   - **Objective**: Measure the impact of ghost reviews on customer decisions and competitor revenue.
   - **Approach**:
     - **Footfall Analysis**:
       - Use mapping APIs (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap) to analyze customer movement patterns.
       - Compare footfall data for competitors near inactive businesses with and without ghost reviews.
     - **Revenue Leakage Estimation**:
       - Partner with businesses to analyze sales data and correlate it with the presence of ghost reviews.
       - Use statistical models to estimate revenue redirected due to misleading reviews.
     - **Customer Surveys**:
       - Conduct surveys to understand how ghost reviews influence customer choices.
   - **Output**: A report quantifying the economic impact of ghost reviews on competitors.

---

### **4. Proposed Fix: Platform-Level Reforms**
   - **Objective**: Advocate for changes to review platforms to address ghost reviews.
   - **Approach**:
     - **Inactivity Tagging**:
       - Propose that platforms automatically tag reviews from inactive businesses (e.g., “This business is closed”).
     - **Review Archiving**:
       - Suggest archiving reviews after a business has been inactive for a set period (e.g., 6 months).
     - **User Alerts**:
       - Recommend notifying users when they view reviews for inactive businesses.
     - **Transparency Reports**:
       - Encourage platforms to publish data on ghost reviews and their handling processes.
   - **Output**: A white paper or proposal for review platforms outlining these reforms.

## **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Web Scraping and Data Collection**
```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

def scrape_reviews(business_url):
    response = requests.get(business_url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    reviews = soup.find_all('div', class_='review-content')
    return [review.text for review in reviews]

# Example usage
business_url = "https://example.com/business-reviews"
reviews = scrape_reviews(business_url)
print(reviews)
```

### **2. Sentiment Analysis**
```python
from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

def analyze_sentiment(reviews):
    analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
    sentiments = [analyzer.polarity_scores(review) for review in reviews]
    return sentiments

# Example usage
sentiments = analyze_sentiment(reviews)
print(sentiments)
```

### **3. Economic Impact Modeling**
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def estimate_revenue_leakage(footfall_data, sales_data):
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(footfall_data, sales_data)
    return model.predict(footfall_data)

# Example usage
footfall_data = pd.DataFrame({'footfall': [100, 150, 200]})
sales_data = pd.DataFrame({'sales': [1000, 1500, 2000]})
predicted_sales = estimate_revenue_leakage(footfall_data, sales_data)
print(predicted_sales)
```
