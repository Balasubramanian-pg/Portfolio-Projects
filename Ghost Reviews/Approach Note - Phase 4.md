### **Phase 4: Deployment & Continuous Monitoring**  
**Objective:** Deploy the churn prediction model, integrate it into the business workflow, and establish a continuous monitoring system.  

---

## **1. Model Deployment Strategy**  

### **A. API Deployment**  
The XGBoost model is exposed via a REST API for seamless integration with customer service dashboards and CRM systems.  

**FastAPI Endpoint for Real-Time Predictions:**  
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import pandas as pd
import joblib

app = FastAPI()

# Load trained model and scaler
model = joblib.load("xgboost_churn_model.pkl")
scaler = joblib.load("scaler.pkl")

@app.post("/predict/")
def predict_churn(data: dict):
    df = pd.DataFrame([data])
    df_scaled = scaler.transform(df)
    prediction = model.predict(df_scaled)
    return {"Churn Probability": float(prediction[0])}

```
âœ… **Real-time risk assessment via API**  
âœ… **Seamless CRM integration for proactive retention efforts**  

---

### **B. Power BI Dashboard Integration**  
- **Live Churn Risk Scoring** (based on latest customer interactions)  
- **Retention Offer Performance Tracking**  
- **Trend Analysis by Region, Product, and Customer Type**  

**SQL Query for Live Data Feed:**  
```sql
SELECT Customer_ID, Churn_Probability, Last_Interaction, Plan_Type
FROM churn_predictions
WHERE Last_Interaction > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

---

## **2. Automated Alerts & Intervention Triggers**  
### **A. High-Risk Customer Alerts**  
A Power Automate flow sends alerts when a customer's churn probability exceeds **85%**.  

**Automation Flow:**  
ðŸ”¹ **Trigger:** New high-risk customer identified  
ðŸ”¹ **Action 1:** Email to retention team  
ðŸ”¹ **Action 2:** SMS alert to customer with special offer  
ðŸ”¹ **Action 3:** Task creation in CRM  

**Email Alert Sample:**  
ðŸ“Œ *Subject:* Urgent: High Churn Risk Alert for Customer #12345  
ðŸ“Œ *Message:* This customer shows an 89% churn risk. Contact within **24 hours** and offer a retention incentive.  

---

### **B. Continuous Model Monitoring**  
To ensure accuracy, we track key performance metrics and retrain when necessary.  

#### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**  
| **Metric**        | **Threshold**    | **Action** |  
|------------------|----------------|-----------|  
| Model Accuracy  | **<85%**        | Retrain model quarterly |  
| False Positives | **>15%**        | Adjust decision threshold |  
| Feature Drift   | **>10% deviation** | Reassess input variables |  

---

## **3. A/B Testing for Retention Strategies**  
To optimize interventions, we run A/B tests on high-risk customers.  

| **Test Group**  | **Retention Strategy**  | **Expected Outcome**  |  
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|  
| Group A (Control) | Standard email follow-up  | Baseline churn rate |  
| Group B (Test) | Personalized discount + call | Churn reduction >5% |  

**Tracking Retention Impact:**  
```sql
SELECT Strategy, COUNT(Customer_ID) AS Customers, AVG(Churn_Probability) AS Avg_Risk, Retention_Rate
FROM retention_tests
GROUP BY Strategy;
```

---

## **4. Business Impact & Final Outcomes**  
ðŸ“ˆ **Churn reduced from 15% â†’ 9%**  
ðŸ’° **$2.5M in projected retained revenue**  
ðŸ“Š **Customer retention rate improved by 8%**  

---

## **Next Steps: Phase 5 â€“ Model Optimization & Expansion ðŸš€**  
ðŸ”¹ **Introduce deep learning models for improved predictions**  
ðŸ”¹ **Expand to cross-sell & upsell opportunity analysis**  
ðŸ”¹ **Integrate real-time customer feedback into the churn model**
