## **Expanded Solutioning**

### **1. Data Aggregation**
   - **Objective**: Integrate wellness data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive pet health profile.
   - **Approach**:
     - Use IoT devices (e.g., smart collars, activity trackers) to collect real-time data on activity levels, sleep patterns, and location.
     - Integrate with veterinary systems to access medical records, vaccination schedules, and treatment plans.
     - Allow manual input for diet, grooming, and other wellness activities.
   - **Output**: A centralized database of pet wellness data.

---

### **2. Predictive Alerts**
   - **Objective**: Notify pet owners about upcoming wellness needs.
   - **Approach**:
     - Use predictive analytics to identify upcoming needs (e.g., vaccinations, check-ups, medication refills).
     - Send push notifications, emails, or SMS alerts to remind pet owners.
     - Allow customization of alert preferences (e.g., frequency, type of alerts).
   - **Output**: Timely and relevant alerts for pet wellness needs.

---

### **3. Personalized Recommendations**
   - **Objective**: Provide tailored recommendations for diet, exercise, and vet services.
   - **Approach**:
     - Use machine learning algorithms to analyze wellness data and generate recommendations.
     - Suggest diets based on breed, age, and health conditions.
     - Recommend exercise routines based on activity levels and weight goals.
     - Provide vet service recommendations based on location and pet health needs.
   - **Output**: Personalized wellness plans for each pet.

---

### **4. Network Collaboration**
   - **Objective**: Connect pet owners to local services and communities.
   - **Approach**:
     - Partner with local veterinarians, pet stores, and groomers to offer services through the platform.
     - Create a community feature for pet owners to share tips, experiences, and recommendations.
     - Provide a directory of local pet services with reviews and ratings.
   - **Output**: A network of local services and a supportive pet owner community.

## **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Data Aggregation**
```python
import requests

# Example: Fetch activity data from a smart collar API
def fetch_activity_data(api_key, pet_id):
    url = f"https://api.smartcollar.com/activity?api_key={api_key}&pet_id={pet_id}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()

# Example usage
api_key = "your_api_key"
pet_id = "pet123"
activity_data = fetch_activity_data(api_key, pet_id)
print(activity_data)
```

### **2. Predictive Alerts**
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Example: Generate alerts for upcoming vaccinations
def generate_vaccination_alerts(vaccination_schedule):
    alerts = []
    for vaccine in vaccination_schedule:
        due_date = datetime.strptime(vaccine['due_date'], '%Y-%m-%d')
        if due_date - datetime.now() < timedelta(days=7):
            alerts.append(f"Upcoming vaccination: {vaccine['name']} on {vaccine['due_date']}")
    return alerts

# Example usage
vaccination_schedule = [
    {'name': 'Rabies', 'due_date': '2023-11-15'},
    {'name': 'Distemper', 'due_date': '2023-12-01'}
]
alerts = generate_vaccination_alerts(vaccination_schedule)
for alert in alerts:
    print(alert)
```

### **3. Personalized Recommendations**
```python
# Example: Recommend diet based on pet's age and weight
def recommend_diet(age, weight):
    if age < 2:
        return "Puppy/Kitten food with high protein"
    elif weight > 30:
        return "Weight management diet"
    else:
        return "Standard adult pet food"

# Example usage
age = 1.5  # in years
weight = 35  # in pounds
diet = recommend_diet(age, weight)
print(f"Recommended diet: {diet}")
```

### **4. Network Collaboration**
```python
# Example: Find local veterinarians
def find_local_vets(location):
    vets = [
        {'name': 'Happy Paws Clinic', 'location': '123 Main St', 'rating': 4.5},
        {'name': 'Pet Wellness Center', 'location': '456 Elm St', 'rating': 4.8}
    ]
    return [vet for vet in vets if location in vet['location']]

# Example usage
location = 'Main St'
local_vets = find_local_vets(location)
for vet in local_vets:
    print(f"{vet['name']} - {vet['location']} (Rating: {vet['rating']})")
```
