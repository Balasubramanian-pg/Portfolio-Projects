# **Approach Note: Phase 3 – Profit Conversion & Revenue Modeling**  
**Project**: FreshPlate Food Waste Reduction Initiative  
**Owner**: [Intern Name] | **Date**: [Insert Date] | **Tools**: Excel, Power BI  

---

## **Objective**  
Convert 50% of FreshPlate’s unavoidable food waste into revenue streams through upcycled food products and bio-energy partnerships, targeting $10K/month in new revenue within 6 months.  

---

## **Scope**  
- **Focus Areas**:  
  1. **Upcycled Products**: Develop 3 product lines using waste ingredients (e.g., stale bread → breadcrumbs).  
  2. **Bio-Energy Partnerships**: Model revenue from converting organic waste to biogas/compost.  
  3. **ROI Analysis**: Compare costs of waste disposal vs. profit from conversion.  
- **Exclusions**: Regulatory approvals for new food products (handled by legal team).  

---

## **Data Sources**  
1. **Waste Composition Data**: From Phase 1 audit (e.g., 300kg/week of stale bread).  
2. **Supplier Quotes**:  
   - Upcycling costs (labor, packaging, marketing).  
   - Bio-energy rates ($/ton for compost, biogas energy output).  
3. **Market Research**: Competitor pricing for upcycled products (e.g., "Regrained" beer from bread).

## **Methodology**  

### **Step 1: Product Feasibility Analysis (Excel)**  
**Task**: Identify viable upcycled products using waste inventory.  

#### **Sample Dataset (Excel)**:  
| Waste_Item   | Weekly_Volume_kg | Upcycled_Product | Input_kg_per_unit | Labor_Cost/unit | Packaging_Cost/unit | Target_Price/unit |  
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------|  
| Stale Bread  | 300               | Breadcrumbs       | 0.5                | $0.80           | $0.30               | $4.50              |  
| Fruit Scraps | 150               | Fruit Jam         | 0.3                | $1.20           | $0.60               | $6.00              |  

**Key Formulas**:  
- **COGS/Unit**: `= (Labor_Cost + Packaging_Cost + (Input_kg_per_unit * $Waste_Disposal_Cost/kg))`  
  *(Assume waste disposal costs $0.20/kg)*  
- **Profit/Unit**: `= Target_Price - COGS`  
- **Break-Even Volume**: `= Fixed_Costs / (Target_Price - COGS)`  

**Deliverable**:  
- Excel model with dynamic assumptions (e.g., 10% cost inflation).  
- Sensitivity analysis for pricing/cost variables.

### **Step 2: Bio-Energy Revenue Modeling (Excel)**  
**Task**: Estimate revenue from biogas/compost partnerships.  

| Metric               | Value                     |  
|----------------------|---------------------------|  
| Organic Waste Volume | 2,000 kg/week             |  
| Biogas Yield         | 100 m³/ton                |  
| Biogas Price         | $0.15/m³                  |  
| Compost Revenue      | $25/ton                   |  

**Calculations**:  
- Weekly Biogas Revenue: `= (2000 kg / 1000) * 100 m³/ton * $0.15 = $30/week`  
- Annual Compost Revenue: `= (2000 kg * 52 weeks / 1000) * $25 = $2,600/year`  

---

### **Step 3: Power BI Revenue Dashboard**  
**Requirements**:  
1. **Metrics**:  
   - Monthly revenue from upcycled products vs. targets.  
   - Waste diversion rate (kg converted vs. total waste).  
   - ROI of upcycling vs. disposal costs.  
2. **Visuals**:  
   - Bar chart comparing revenue by product line.  
   - Map showing bio-energy partners by location.  

**Sample DAX Measures**:  
```  
ROI = DIVIDE([Total Revenue] - [Total Cost], [Total Cost])  
Waste Diversion Rate = DIVIDE(SUM(Upcycled[Input_kg]), SUM(Waste[Quantity_kg]))  
```  

**Integration**:  
- Connect Excel models to Power BI via direct query.  
- Add filters for product type, location, and time period.

## **Deliverables**  
1. **Excel Financial Models**:  
   - `Upcycled_Products_Model.xlsx`: Break-even analysis, profit margins.  
   - `BioEnergy_Revenue_Calculator.xlsx`: Energy yield and revenue projections.  
2. **Power BI Dashboard**:  
   - Tabs: Product Performance, Bio-Energy ROI, Waste Diversion Metrics.  
3. **Product Launch Proposal**:  
   - 2-pager recommending top 3 upcycled products (e.g., breadcrumbs, veggie broth).

## **Timeline**  
| Task                          | Duration | Owner       |  
|-------------------------------|----------|-------------|  
| Product Feasibility Analysis  | 5 days   | Intern      |  
| Bio-Energy Modeling           | 3 days   | Intern      |  
| Dashboard Development         | 4 days   | Intern      |  
| Stakeholder Review            | 2 days   | Intern + Manager |

## **Risks & Mitigation**  
| Risk                                  | Mitigation                                  |  
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|  
| Low consumer interest in upcycled products | Pilot in 3 locations before scaling.      |  
| Inaccurate biogas yield assumptions   | Partner with bio-energy vendor for validation. |  
| High upfront packaging costs          | Negotiate bulk discounts with suppliers.   |  

---

## **Next Steps**  
1. Partner with a local bakery to pilot breadcrumb production.  
2. Finalize bio-energy contracts with waste management firms.  
3. Transition to Phase 4: Circular Economy Dashboard integration.

### **Appendix: Real-World Scenario**  
**Mock Challenge**:  
- **Problem**: The COGS for fruit jam exceeds competitor pricing by 20%.  
- **Intern Task**:  
  1. Use Excel’s **Solver** to adjust input ratios (e.g., reduce fruit scraps from 0.3kg to 0.25kg/unit).  
  2. Model impact on profit margin:  
     ```  
     New COGS = $1.20 (labor) + $0.60 (packaging) + (0.25kg * $0.20) = $1.85  
     New Profit = $6.00 - $1.85 = $4.15/unit (22% margin improvement)  
     ```
