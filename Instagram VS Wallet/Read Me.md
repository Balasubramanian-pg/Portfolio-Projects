     - Identify patterns in TikTok trends (e.g., peak popularity, decline).
     - Correlate trends with purchase and regret data.
   - **Regret Analysis**:
     - Use machine learning to predict regret based on factors like price, trend longevity, and sentiment.
     - Segment regret rates by product category, demographic, and region.
   - **Sentiment Analysis**:
     - Analyze product reviews and survey responses to gauge satisfaction and identify common pain points.

### **3. Tool Development**
   - **Consumer-Facing App**:
     - Provide real-time insights into TikTok trends and their potential for regret.
     - Offer personalized recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.
   - **Business Dashboard**:
     - Visualize trend impact, regret rates, and return data.
     - Provide actionable insights for inventory planning and marketing strategies.

### **4. Testing and Validation**
   - **A/B Testing**:
     - Test different interventions (e.g., product recommendations, trend warnings) to reduce regret.
   - **User Feedback**:
     - Continuously gather feedback from consumers and businesses to refine the tool.

### **5. Scaling and Deployment**
