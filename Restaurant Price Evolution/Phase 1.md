**Approach Note for Phase 1: Data Extraction & Cleanup**

### **Objective:**
To digitize and structure historical menu data from various sources, ensuring accuracy and consistency for further analysis.

---

### **Scope of Work:**
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather menu data from **PDFs, scanned images, handwritten records, and printed documents**.
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage across **all locations and time periods**.

2. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Processing:**
   - Use **Tesseract OCR** for standard printed text extraction.
   - Apply **AWS Textract** for processing handwritten and complex layouts.
   - Utilize **OpenCV** for image pre-processing (contrast enhancement, noise reduction) to improve OCR accuracy.

3. **Data Structuring & Standardization:**
   - Convert extracted data into a structured **SQL database** with defined fields:
     - **Item Name**
     - **Price**
     - **Category** (e.g., Appetizers, Main Course, Beverages)
     - **Location**
     - **Date** of menu issuance
   - Standardize menu item names using **fuzzy matching algorithms** to correct OCR misreads and naming inconsistencies.
   
4. **Data Cleaning & Validation:**
   - Perform **automated anomaly detection** to identify missing or erroneous values.
   - Cross-check extracted data with **historical financial records** to ensure accuracy.
   - Implement a **manual review process** for a sample dataset to achieve **98%+ accuracy**.

5. **Error Logging & Refinement:**
   - Maintain an **error log** to track OCR failures and refine extraction techniques iteratively.
   - Develop an **adaptive machine learning model** to enhance future OCR accuracy.

### **Deliverables:**
✅ **Structured SQL database** containing cleaned and categorized menu data.
✅ **OCR accuracy report**, highlighting failure cases and refinements.
✅ **Error log & improvement plan** for continuous enhancement.

---

### **Expected Outcome:**
By the end of Phase 1, we will have a **fully structured and validated menu dataset**, ensuring a strong foundation for further price evolution analysis. This will enable seamless integration with cost tracking, competitor benchmarking, and pricing optimization models in subsequent phases.

---

**Next Steps:**
- Review structured database outputs with key stakeholders.
- Optimize OCR models based on initial error analysis.
- Prepare for Phase 2: **Time-Series Analysis & Cost Correlation**.
