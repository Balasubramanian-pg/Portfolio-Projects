### **Phase 4: Predictive Pricing Optimization**  

#### **Objective**  
To leverage data analytics and machine learning models to optimize menu pricing dynamically, ensuring maximum profitability while maintaining competitiveness and customer retention.  

---

### **Key Challenges & Solutions**  

1. **Lack of Predictive Models for Price Optimization**  
   - *Challenge*: Current pricing decisions are static and lack predictive insights.  
   - *Solution*: Implement **machine learning models** to forecast demand, price elasticity, and revenue impact based on historical data.  

2. **Balancing Profitability & Customer Retention**  
   - *Challenge*: Aggressive price hikes can drive away customers, while underpricing reduces margins.  
   - *Solution*: Deploy **elasticity-based pricing strategies**, segmenting items into **high-margin, high-volume, and price-sensitive** categories.  

3. **Seasonal & Demand-Based Pricing Adjustments**  
   - *Challenge*: Demand fluctuations are not reflected in current pricing.  
   - *Solution*: Use **time-series forecasting** to anticipate demand spikes (e.g., weekends, festive seasons) and adjust pricing accordingly.

### **Methodology**  

1. **Data Preparation & Feature Engineering**  
   - Consolidate **historical sales data**, competitor prices, weather conditions, holidays, and promotions.  
   - Engineer features like **day of the week, time of the day, seasonality trends** for ML modeling.  

2. **Machine Learning-Based Pricing Model**  
   - Train a **Random Forest Regression Model** to predict optimal price points for each menu item based on:  
     - Historical sales trends  
     - Competitor pricing  
     - Demand elasticity  
     - Seasonal effects  

   **Sample Python Code for Price Prediction:**  
   ```python
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

   # Load Data
   df = pd.read_csv('menu_sales_data.csv')
   X = df[['competitor_price', 'day_of_week', 'seasonality_index', 'previous_sales']]
   y = df['optimal_price']

   # Train Model
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
   model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)

   # Predict Optimal Prices
   df['predicted_price'] = model.predict(X)
   df[['item_name', 'predicted_price']].head()
   ```  

3. **Scenario Planning & Price Experimentation**  
   - Conduct **A/B pricing tests** for selected items.  
   - Evaluate impact on **order volume, revenue, and customer satisfaction**.  
   - Adjust pricing dynamically based on model insights.
