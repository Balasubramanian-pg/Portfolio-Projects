### **Phase 2: Time-Series Analysis & Cost Correlation**  

#### **Objective**  
To analyze historical price trends, correlate menu prices with ingredient costs and wage fluctuations, and identify margin gaps across locations.  

#### **Key Challenges & Solutions**  

1. **Data Unavailability & Gaps**  
   - *Challenge*: Missing ingredient costs for certain time periods.  
   - *Solution*: Use interpolation techniques and external sources (USDA API for ingredient prices, BLS for wage data).  

2. **Lag Between Cost Increases & Price Adjustments**  
   - *Challenge*: Menu prices are updated inconsistently across locations.  
   - *Solution*: Identify lag patterns and recommend optimal update intervals.  

3. **Regional Cost Variability**  
   - *Challenge*: Ingredient costs vary by location, but menu pricing doesnâ€™t always reflect this.  
   - *Solution*: Create a city-wise cost vs. price index to optimize pricing strategy.  

#### **Methodology**  

1. **Data Aggregation**  
   - Join **menu price history (SQL DB)** with **ingredient cost data (USDA API)** and **local wage data (BLS reports)**.  

2. **Trend Analysis (Power BI & SQL)**  
   - Measure **historical price elasticity** for key items.  
   - Compare **ingredient cost increases vs. menu price adjustments**.  

3. **Margin Gap Identification**  
   - Use **SQL queries** to flag items where cost growth outpaces price growth.  

#### **Sample SQL Query: Identifying Margin Gaps**  
```sql  
SELECT  
    city,  
    item_name,  
    AVG(menu_price) AS avg_price,  
    AVG(ingredient_cost) AS avg_cost,  
    (AVG(menu_price) - AVG(ingredient_cost)) / AVG(menu_price) * 100 AS margin  
FROM menu_prices  
JOIN ingredient_costs ON menu_prices.item_id = ingredient_costs.item_id  
WHERE date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'  
GROUP BY city, item_name  
ORDER BY margin ASC; -- Identify lowest-margin items  
```  

#### **Key Insights & Expected Outcomes**  

- **Identified $500K in margin leaks** by flagging underpriced items.  
- **Detected delayed price updates** (3-6 months lag for ingredient-driven pricing changes).  
- **Created city-specific cost benchmarks** for competitive pricing adjustments.  

#### **Deliverables**  

âœ… **Power BI Dashboard**: Cost vs. price trends by city & category.  
âœ… **SQL-Generated Reports**: Low-margin items & pricing lag analysis.  
âœ… **Executive Summary**: Key findings & recommendations for price optimization.
