### **Phase 3: Competitive Benchmarking & Market Positioning**  

#### **Objective**  
To benchmark menu pricing against competitors, assess market positioning, and recommend strategic price adjustments to enhance profitability and competitiveness.  

#### **Key Challenges & Solutions**  

1. **Limited Access to Competitor Pricing Data**  
   - *Challenge*: Direct competitor pricing data is not publicly available.  
   - *Solution*: Utilize web scraping techniques, third-party market intelligence reports, and customer feedback surveys to approximate competitor pricing.  

2. **Dynamic Pricing in the Market**  
   - *Challenge*: Some competitors use AI-driven dynamic pricing, making benchmarking complex.  
   - *Solution*: Categorize competitors into **fixed pricing** and **dynamic pricing models** and assess pricing volatility trends.  

3. **Regional Pricing Disparities**  
   - *Challenge*: Pricing variations exist across cities due to differences in cost structures and consumer demand.  
   - *Solution*: Develop a **regional price comparison index** to highlight gaps and opportunities for localized pricing strategies.

```sql  
SELECT  
    a.city,  
    a.item_name,  
    a.avg_price AS our_price,  
    b.avg_price AS competitor_price,  
    (a.avg_price - b.avg_price) / b.avg_price * 100 AS price_difference  
FROM menu_prices a  
JOIN competitor_prices b ON a.item_name = b.item_name AND a.city = b.city  
WHERE a.date = '2024-01-01'  
ORDER BY price_difference ASC; -- Identifying underpriced & overpriced items  
```
