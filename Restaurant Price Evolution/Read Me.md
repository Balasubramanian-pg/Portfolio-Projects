## **Refined Problem Statement**

**How can restaurants and analysts track and analyze the evolution of menu prices over time, using historical data and comparative insights, to optimize pricing strategies and predict customer reactions?**

---

## **Key Questions to Ask**

### **For Restaurants**
1. How have menu prices changed over time, and what factors (e.g., ingredient costs, economic conditions) drove these changes?
2. How do current prices compare to competitors, and are there opportunities to adjust pricing for better profitability or customer appeal?
3. How do customers react to price changes, and what is the optimal price point for key items?

### **For Analysts**
1. What historical data is available to analyze menu price trends?
2. How can we identify patterns in price evolution across different categories (e.g., appetizers, entrees, desserts)?
3. What tools and methodologies are best suited for analyzing and visualizing menu price data?

### **For Customers**
1. How do price changes influence customer satisfaction and purchasing behavior?
2. What pricing strategies (e.g., value meals, premium pricing) are most appealing to different customer segments?

## **Expanded Solutioning**

### **1. Data Collection**
   - **Objective**: Digitize and organize historical menu data for analysis.
   - **Approach**:
     - Use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools (e.g., Tesseract, Google Vision API) to extract text from scanned or photographed menus.
     - Store the digitized data in a SQL database for easy querying and analysis.
     - Include metadata such as date, location, and menu category for each item.
   - **Output**: A structured database of historical menu prices.

### **2. Time-Series Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Analyze price trends over time for key menu items.
   - **Approach**:
     - Use time-series analysis techniques to track price changes for individual items and categories.
     - Identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies in pricing data.
     - Correlate price changes with external factors (e.g., inflation, ingredient costs, economic conditions).
   - **Output**: Visualizations and insights into menu price evolution.

---

### **3. Comparative Insights**
   - **Objective**: Compare menu prices with competitors to identify opportunities for optimization.
   - **Approach**:
     - Collect competitor menu data using similar OCR and database techniques.
     - Perform comparative analysis to identify underpriced or overpriced items.
     - Segment analysis by geographic region, cuisine type, and customer demographics.
   - **Output**: A report highlighting competitive pricing opportunities.

---

### **4. Actionable Strategies**
   - **Objective**: Recommend optimized pricing models based on data-driven insights.
   - **Approach**:
     - **Dynamic Pricing**: Suggest dynamic pricing strategies based on demand and competition.
     - **Value Meals**: Recommend bundled offers or value meals to increase perceived value.
     - **Premium Pricing**: Identify opportunities for premium pricing on high-demand or unique items.
     - **Promotions**: Suggest targeted promotions to drive sales of underperforming items.
   - **Output**: A set of tailored pricing recommendations for restaurants.

## **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Data Collection with OCR**
```python
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract

# Example: Extract text from a menu image using Tesseract OCR
def extract_menu_text(image_path):
    image = Image.open(image_path)
    text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)
    return text

# Example usage
image_path = "menu_image.jpg"
menu_text = extract_menu_text(image_path)
print(menu_text)
```

### **2. Time-Series Analysis**
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example: Analyze price trends over time
def analyze_price_trends(menu_data):
    menu_data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(menu_data['date'])
    menu_data.set_index('date', inplace=True)
    menu_data['price'].plot(title='Menu Price Trends Over Time')
    plt.show()

# Example usage
menu_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'date': ['2023-01-01', '2023-02-01', '2023-03-01'],
    'price': [10, 12, 11]
})
analyze_price_trends(menu_data)
```

### **3. Comparative Analysis**
```python
# Example: Compare prices with competitors
def compare_prices(restaurant_prices, competitor_prices):
    comparison = pd.merge(restaurant_prices, competitor_prices, on='item', suffixes=('_restaurant', '_competitor'))
    comparison['price_difference'] = comparison['price_restaurant'] - comparison['price_competitor']
    return comparison

# Example usage
restaurant_prices = pd.DataFrame({
    'item': ['Burger', 'Pizza'],
    'price': [10, 12]
})
competitor_prices = pd.DataFrame({
    'item': ['Burger', 'Pizza'],
    'price': [9, 13]
})
price_comparison = compare_prices(restaurant_prices, competitor_prices)
print(price_comparison)
```

### **4. Data Visualization**
   - Use data visualization platforms like Power BI or Tableau to create interactive dashboards:
     - Visualize price trends over time.
     - Highlight competitive pricing insights.
     - Provide actionable recommendations.
