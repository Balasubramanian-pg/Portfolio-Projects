### **Key Challenges & Solutions**  

1. **Operationalizing Data-Driven Pricing**  
   - *Challenge*: Transitioning from static to dynamic pricing without disrupting operations.  
   - *Solution*: Implement an **automated pricing engine** integrated with the Point-of-Sale (POS) system.  

2. **User Adoption & Change Management**  
   - *Challenge*: Resistance from stakeholders (restaurant managers, finance teams) to trust AI-driven pricing.  
   - *Solution*: **User training sessions**, real-time dashboards, and phased rollout to build confidence.  

3. **Ensuring Continuous Improvement & Model Accuracy**  
   - *Challenge*: Market trends and customer behavior evolve, requiring ongoing model updates.  
   - *Solution*: Implement an **AI-powered feedback loop** that retrains models with new data periodically.

### **Methodology**  

1. **Seamless Integration with POS & Order Management Systems**  
   - Deploy the predictive pricing engine via an **API that dynamically updates prices** in the POS system.  
   - Enable real-time price adjustments based on demand, inventory, and external factors (e.g., weather, competitor pricing).  

2. **Real-Time Monitoring & Exception Handling**  
   - Establish a **price monitoring dashboard** to track performance.  
   - Implement **override mechanisms** to allow manual interventions if required.  

3. **Feedback Loop & Model Refinement**  
   - Schedule **automated retraining** of pricing models every **30-60 days** using updated sales data.  
   - Apply **reinforcement learning techniques** to optimize price points dynamically.
