## **Expanded Solutioning**

### **1. Data Collection**
   - **Objective**: Gather data on post-party or hangover-related purchases.
   - **Approach**:
     - Partner with food delivery apps (e.g., Uber Eats, DoorDash) to access transaction data for late-night and early-morning orders.
     - Collaborate with convenience stores, pharmacies, and wellness brands to track sales of hangover-related products (e.g., electrolyte drinks, pain relievers).
     - Use surveys to collect self-reported data on post-party spending habits.
   - **Output**: A dataset of post-party purchases and consumer behavior.

---

### **2. Trend Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Identify trends in post-party spending patterns.
   - **Approach**:
     - Analyze transaction data to identify peak purchase times (e.g., early morning after a night out).
     - Segment data by product category (e.g., food, beverages, wellness) and demographic (e.g., age, gender, location).
     - Identify seasonal trends (e.g., increased spending during holidays or weekends).
   - **Output**: Insights into post-party spending trends and patterns.

---

### **3. Consumer Segmentation**
   - **Objective**: Segment consumers based on post-party spending behavior.
   - **Approach**:
     - Use clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means) to group consumers with similar spending habits.
     - Create personas for different segments (e.g., "Fast Food Fanatics," "Wellness Warriors").
     - Analyze how each segment responds to marketing campaigns or promotions.
   - **Output**: Consumer segments and personas for targeted marketing.

---

### **4. Marketing and Product Optimization**
   - **Objective**: Develop strategies to capitalize on the "hangover economy."
   - **Approach**:
     - **Product Recommendations**: Suggest new products or bundles tailored to hungover consumers (e.g., "Hangover Recovery Kits").
     - **Targeted Campaigns**: Create marketing campaigns for specific segments (e.g., discounts on breakfast delivery for late-night partiers).
     - **Partnerships**: Partner with complementary brands to offer bundled deals (e.g., a fast food chain and a hydration drink brand).
   - **Output**: Actionable strategies for businesses to optimize offerings and marketing.

## **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Data Collection**
```python
import requests

# Example: Fetch transaction data from a food delivery API
def fetch_transactions(api_key, start_date, end_date):
    url = f"https://api.fooddelivery.com/transactions?api_key={api_key}&start_date={start_date}&end_date={end_date}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()

# Example usage
api_key = "your_api_key"
start_date = "2023-10-01"
end_date = "2023-10-31"
transactions = fetch_transactions(api_key, start_date, end_date)
print(transactions)
```

### **2. Trend Analysis**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Example: Analyze peak purchase times
def analyze_purchase_times(transactions):
    transactions['time'] = pd.to_datetime(transactions['time'])
    transactions['hour'] = transactions['time'].dt.hour
    peak_hours = transactions['hour'].value_counts().idxmax()
    return peak_hours

# Example usage
transactions = pd.DataFrame({
    'time': ['2023-10-01 08:00', '2023-10-01 09:00', '2023-10-01 10:00'],
    'amount': [20, 15, 25]
})
peak_hour = analyze_purchase_times(transactions)
print(f"Peak purchase hour: {peak_hour}:00")
```

### **3. Consumer Segmentation**
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Example: Segment consumers based on spending habits
def segment_consumers(transactions):
    X = transactions[['amount', 'hour']]
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
    transactions['segment'] = kmeans.fit_predict(X)
    return transactions

# Example usage
transactions = pd.DataFrame({
    'amount': [20, 15, 25, 30, 10],
    'hour': [8, 9, 10, 8, 9]
})
segmented_transactions = segment_consumers(transactions)
print(segmented_transactions)
```

### **4. Marketing Campaign Simulation**
```python
# Example: Simulate the impact of a targeted campaign
def simulate_campaign(segment, discount):
    base_spend = segment['amount'].mean()
    increased_spend = base_spend * (1 + discount)
    return increased_spend

# Example usage
segment = pd.DataFrame({'amount': [20, 15, 25]})
discount = 0.1  # 10% discount
increased_spend = simulate_campaign(segment, discount)
print(f"Expected spend after campaign: ${increased_spend:.2f}")
```
