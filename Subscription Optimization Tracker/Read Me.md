## **Expanded Solutioning**

### **1. Transaction Monitoring**
   - **Objective**: Identify recurring payments and subscriptions.
   - **Approach**:
     - Integrate with bank APIs (e.g., Plaid, Yodlee) to access transaction data securely.
     - Use pattern recognition algorithms to identify recurring payments (e.g., monthly, annual).
     - Categorize transactions into subscription types (e.g., streaming, software, fitness).
   - **Output**: A categorized list of subscriptions and recurring payments.

---

### **2. Usage Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Track usage patterns to identify underutilized subscriptions.
   - **Approach**:
     - For digital services (e.g., streaming, apps), use APIs or screen time tracking to monitor usage.
     - For physical services (e.g., gym memberships), integrate with check-in systems or allow manual input.
     - Analyze usage data to identify subscriptions with low or no activity.
   - **Output**: Usage insights for each subscription.

---

### **3. Optimization Dashboard**
   - **Objective**: Provide personalized recommendations to optimize subscriptions.
   - **Approach**:
     - Develop a dashboard that visualizes subscription costs, usage, and savings potential.
     - Use AI to recommend actions (e.g., cancel, downgrade, switch plans) based on usage and cost.
     - Highlight overlapping services (e.g., multiple streaming platforms) and suggest consolidations.
   - **Output**: A user-friendly dashboard with actionable recommendations.

---

### **4. Smart Alerts**
   - **Objective**: Notify users about unused subscriptions or upcoming renewals.
   - **Approach**:
     - Set up push notifications or email alerts for:
       - Subscriptions with no recent usage.
       - Upcoming renewals or price changes.
       - Opportunities to save (e.g., discounts, promotions).
     - Allow users to customize alert preferences.
   - **Output**: Timely and relevant alerts to help users manage subscriptions.

## **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Transaction Monitoring**
```python
import plaid
from plaid.api import plaid_api

# Example: Fetch transactions using Plaid API
def fetch_transactions(access_token):
    configuration = plaid.Configuration(
        host=plaid.Environment.Sandbox,
        api_key={
            'clientId': 'your_client_id',
            'secret': 'your_secret',
        }
    )
    api_client = plaid.ApiClient(configuration)
    client = plaid_api.PlaidApi(api_client)
    response = client.transactions_get(access_token, start_date='2023-01-01', end_date='2023-12-31')
    return response['transactions']

# Example usage
access_token = 'your_access_token'
transactions = fetch_transactions(access_token)
print(transactions)
```

### **2. Usage Analysis**
```python
# Example: Track app usage (simplified)
def track_app_usage(app_name, usage_data):
    total_usage = sum(usage_data)
    return total_usage

# Example usage
app_name = 'Netflix'
usage_data = [2, 3, 1, 0, 0]  # Hours used per day
total_usage = track_app_usage(app_name, usage_data)
print(f"Total usage for {app_name}: {total_usage} hours")
```

### **3. Optimization Dashboard**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Example: Generate subscription recommendations
def generate_recommendations(subscriptions):
    recommendations = []
    for sub in subscriptions:
        if sub['usage'] < 5:  # Example threshold for low usage
            recommendations.append(f"Consider canceling {sub['name']} (Usage: {sub['usage']} hours)")
    return recommendations

# Example usage
subscriptions = [
    {'name': 'Netflix', 'usage': 10},
    {'name': 'Spotify', 'usage': 2},
    {'name': 'Gym Membership', 'usage': 0}
]
recommendations = generate_recommendations(subscriptions)
for rec in recommendations:
    print(rec)
```

### **4. Smart Alerts**
```python
# Example: Send alerts for unused subscriptions
def send_alerts(subscriptions):
    for sub in subscriptions:
        if sub['usage'] == 0:
            print(f"Alert: You haven't used {sub['name']} this month. Consider canceling.")

# Example usage
send_alerts(subscriptions)
```
